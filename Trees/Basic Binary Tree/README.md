# BinaryTree Project

This project implements a unique binary tree, where nodes are inserted from left to right without any particular ordering of the values they hold. The tree structure is built such that the next level of the tree is not started until the current level is completed.

## WARNING: NOT ALL TESTS PASSING (TODO: fix one day ;d)

Code is written and understood but there must be some minor issues in it
