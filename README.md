# Data Structures, Algorithms, and Design Patterns

This repository focuses on reinforcing knowledge and improving understanding of data structures, algorithms, and design patterns. It serves as a personal learning space to practice and experiment with various software engineering concepts, ultimately enhancing software engineering skills.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

Please note that some implementations in this repository may not be perfect. The primary goal of this project is to create a personal space for practice and exploration of software engineering concepts, rather than providing flawless examples of how different concepts work and are implemented.

This repo should be considered as a collection of experiments and practice exercises I created to help me improve some skills and knowledge required to be a software engineer.

## Feel free though üòÅ
Remember, this is a work in progress and a learning tool, so feel free to explore, experiment, and improve upon the implementations found here.
