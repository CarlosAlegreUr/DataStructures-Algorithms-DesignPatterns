# Factory Method Design Pattern

The Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It's useful for decoupling the process of creating objects from the client that needs them, giving more flexibility in terms of object creation and composition.

## Structure
- **Product**: This is an interface or abstract class, which defines a product to be created.
- **ConcreteProduct**: These classes implement the Product interface.
- **Creator**: This is an abstract class and declares the factory method, which returns an object of the Product type.
- **ConcreteCreator**: These classes implement the factory method to produce ConcreteProduct objects.

## When to Use
The Factory Method pattern is particularly useful:
- When a class can't anticipate the type of objects it needs to create.
- When a class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates.
- When classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses, and you want to localize the knowledge of which helper subclass is the delegate.

## Benefits
- Loose coupling: The client code is decoupled from the concrete product classes.
- Single Responsibility Principle: The code that creates the product is isolated in one place, resulting in easier maintenance.
- Open/Closed Principle: New types of products can be added without modifying existing client code.
