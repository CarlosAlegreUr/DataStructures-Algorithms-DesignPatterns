# Adapter Design Pattern

The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. It's often used when you want to make your own classes work with others without modifying their source code.

## Structure

The Adapter pattern involves a single class, the 'Adapter', which is responsible for communication between the existing ('Adaptee') and the new ('Target') systems.

1. **Target**: This is the domain-specific interface that Client is expected to work with.
2. **Adapter**: This adapts the interface Adaptee to the Target interface.
3. **Adaptee**: This is the existing interface that needs adapting.
4. **Client**: This collaborates with objects conforming to the Target interface.

## When to use

Use the Adapter pattern when you want to use some existing class, but its interface isnâ€™t compatible with the rest of your code. The Adapter pattern lets you create a middle-layer class that serves as a translator between your code and a legacy class, a 3rd-party class or any other class with a weird interface.

## Example

An example can be a card reader acting as an adapter between a memory card and a laptop. The laptop's USB interface is not compatible with the memory card's interface. Therefore, the card reader adapts the memory card's interface to the laptop's interface.
