# Set Implementation in C++

This project provides an implementation of the Set data structure in C++. The Set is a container that stores unique elements in no particular order. 

## Set Implementation Details

Our Set data structure is implemented using a combination of a Hash Map (std::unordered_map) and a Vector of keys. This combination allows for efficient insert, delete, and find operations, while also maintaining the insertion order of the elements. 

## Basic Operations of a Set

This implementation supports the following basic operations:
* Insert: Add an element to the set.
* Remove: Remove an element from the set.
* Contains: Check if an element is in the set.
* Size: Returns the number of elements in the set.

## Alternative Set Implementations

Sets can be implemented with different data structures, each with its own trade-offs:

* **Vector**: A simple array or vector can be used to implement a set. The elements can be kept sorted or unsorted. The advantage of using a vector is its simplicity and support for random access. However, insertion and deletion operations can be slow, especially for large sets.

* **Linked List**: A linked list can also be used to implement a set. This provides efficient insertion and deletion operations but slower search times.

* **Hashmap / Hashtable**: A hashmap can provide average-case constant time, O(1), for insert, delete, and find operations. This is a significant improvement over vector and linked list implementations. However, hashmaps do not preserve any order of elements, and they can be more space-inefficient due to the need to handle potential hash collisions.

* **Balanced Binary Search Tree (e.g., AVL tree, Red-Black tree)**: These can provide a good trade-off between the speed of operations and the preservation of the order of elements. Insertion, deletion, and find operations can all be performed in O(log n) time, and they can also provide ordered traversal of elements.

* **Bit Vector**: If the set elements are from a limited integer range, a bit vector can be used. Each bit in the bit vector represents whether an element is in the set.

* **Trie**: If the set elements are strings, a Trie can be an efficient data structure for a set. A Trie can check if a string is in a set in O(m) time, where m is the length of the string. This can be faster than other data structures if the strings are long and the set is large.
